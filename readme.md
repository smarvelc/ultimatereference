P4 Ultimate Reference

Live URL: http://ultimatereference.smarvelc.me/

The title of my p4 is Ultimate Reference. For many years I have played ultimate frisbee, and I also follow baseball quite closely. Professional baseball has a nifty site called baseball-reference.com which tracks statistics for professional baseball players. As an ultimate player I thought it would be cool to have something similar for frisbee, except, since the sport is still growing it would be nice to have an interactive site where players could register and add their own data.

Unfortunately I was not able to complete my project by the deadline. However, I wanted to show the scaffolding I had built and what functionality I had created so far. I hope to continue working on this and later adding things like a join table between Players and Teams called Leagues so that players can register for more than one team (which frequently happens in ultimate). Other additions/what I had hoped to do can be found in my Jing demo. I'm sorry I wasn't able to complete this project, but I really enjoyed this course and hope to keep studying laravel and continue working on this web app.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
